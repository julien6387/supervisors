.. _synchronizing:

Synchronizing **Supvisors** instances
-------------------------------------

The ``INITIALIZATION`` state of **Supvisors** is used as a synchronization phase so that all **Supvisors**
instances are aware of all of them.

The following options defined in the :ref:`supvisors_section` of the Supervisor configuration file are
particularly used for synchronizing multiple instances of Supervisor:

    * the ``address_list``,
    * the ``internal_port``,
    * the ``synchro_timeout``,
    * the ``auto_fence``.

Once started, all **Supvisors** instances publish the events received, especially the ``TICK`` events
that are produced every 5 seconds, on their ``PUBLISH`` ZeroMQ socket bound on the ``internal_port``.

On the other side, all **Supvisors** instances start a thread that subscribes to the internal events through
an internal ``SUBSCRIBE`` ZeroMQ socket connected to the ``internal_port`` of **all** addresses of the ``address_list``.

At the beginning, all addresses are in an ``UNKNOWN`` state.
When the first ``TICK`` event is received from a remote **Supvisors** instance, the local **Supvisors** instance:

    * sets the remote address state to ``CHECKING``,
    * performs a ``supvisors.get_address_info(local_address)`` XML-RPC to the remote **Supvisors** instance, in order to know how it is seen by the remote instance.
    * 2 possibilities:

        + the local **Supvisors** instance is seen as ``ISOLATED`` by the remote instance:
        
            - it sets the remote address state to ``ISOLATED``,
            - ir disconnects the URL of the remote **Supvisors** instance from the ``SUBSCRIBE`` ZeroMQ socket,

        + the local **Supvisors** instance is NOT seen as ``ISOLATED`` by the remote instance:

            - it performs a ``supervisor.getAllProcessInfo()`` XML-RPC to the remote instance,
            - it loads the processes information into the internal data model,
            - it sets the remote address state to ``RUNNING``.

When all **Supvisors** instances are identified as ``RUNNING`` or ``ISOLATED``, the synchronization is completed.
**Supvisors** then is able to work with the whole set of addresses declared in ``address_list``.

However, it may happen that some **Supvisors** instances do not publish as expected (very late starting, no starting at all,
system down, network down, etc). Each **Supvisors** instance waits for ``synchro_timeout`` seconds to give a chance to all
other instances to publish. When this delay is exceeded, all the **Supvisors** instances that are **not** identified as ``RUNNING``
or ``ISOLATED`` are set to:

    * ``SILENT`` if `Auto-Fencing`_ is **not** activated,
    * ``ISOLATED`` if `Auto-Fencing`_ is activated.

In this case, **Supvisors** will work with a sub-set of the addresses declared in ``address_list``.

Whatever the number of available addresses, **Supvisors** elect a Master among the active addresses and enters in the ``DEPLOYMENT``
phase to start automatically the applications.


.. _auto_fencing:

Auto-Fencing
------------

Auto-fencing is applied when the ``auto_fence`` option of the :ref:`supvisors_section` is set.
It takes place when one of the **Supvisors** instance is seen as inactive (crash, system power down,
network failure) from the other **Supvisors** instances.

In this case, the running **Supvisors** instances disconnect the corresponding URL from their subscription socket.
The address is marked as ``ISOLATED`` and, in accordance with the rules defined and the value of the ``autorestart``
option of the program, **Supvisors** may try to restart somewhere else the processes that were eventually running
on that address.

If the incriminated system restarts, and the **Supvisors** instance is restarted on that system too, the isolation doesn't
prevent the new **Supvisors** instance to receive events from the other instances that have isolated it.
Indeed, it is not possible to filter the subscribers from the ``PUBLISH`` side of a ZeroMQ socket.

That's why a kind of port-knocking is performed in :ref:`synchronizing`. Each newly arrived **Supvisors** instance asks to
the others if it has been previously isolated before taking into account the incoming events.

In the case of a network failure, the same mechanism is of course applied on the other side. Here comes the premices
of a *split-brain syndrome*, as it leads to have 2 separate and identical sets of applications.

If the network failure is fixed, both sets of **Supvisors** are still running but do not communicate between them.

.. attention::
        
    **Supvisors** does NOT isolate the addresses at the operating system level, so that when the incriminated systems
    become active again, it is still possible to perform network requests between all systems, despite the
    **Supvisors** instances do not communicate anymore.

    Similarly, it is outside the scope of **Supvisors** to isolate the address at application level. It is the user's
    responsibility to isolate his applications.


Warm restart
------------

The ``autorestart`` option of Supervisor may be used to restart automatically a process that has crashed or has exited unexpectedly (or not).
However, when the system itself crashes, the other Supervisor instances cannot do anything about that.

**Supvisors** uses the ``running_failure_strategy`` option to warm restart a process that was running on a system that has crashed,
in accordance with the default ``starting_strategy`` set in the :ref:`supvisors_section` and with the ``address_list`` program rules
set in the :ref:`rules_file`.

This option can be also used to stop or restart the whole application after a process crash.


.. _starting_strategy:

Starting strategy
-----------------

**Supvisors** provides a means to start a process without telling explicitly where it has to be started,
and in accordance with the rules defined for this program, i.e. the ``address_list``.


Choosing an address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two rules are applicable with all strategies:

    * the chosen address must be ``RUNNING``,
    * the *loading* of the chosen address must not exceed 100% when adding the ``loading`` of the process to be started.

The *loading* of the chosen address is defined as the sum of the ``loading`` of each process running on this address.

When applying the ``CONFIG`` strategy, **Supvisors** chooses the first address available in the ``address_list``.

When applying the ``LESS_LOADED`` strategy, **Supvisors** chooses the address in the ``address_list`` having the
lowest expected *loading*.
The aim is to distribute the process loading among the available hosts.

When applying the ``MOST_LOADED`` strategy, with respect of the common rules, **Supvisors** chooses the address
in the ``address_list`` having the greatest expected *loading*.
The aim is to maximize the loading of a host before starting to load another host.
This strategy is more interesting when the resources are limited.


Starting a process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The internal *Starter* of **Supervisors** applies the following algorithm to start a process:

| if process state is not ``RUNNING``:
|     choose a starting address for the program in accordance with `Starting strategy`_
|     perform a ``supvisors.start_args(namespec)`` XML-RPC to the **Supvisors** instance running on the chosen address
|

This single job is considered completed when:

    * a ``RUNNING`` event is received and the ``wait_exit`` rule is **not** set for this process,
    * an ``EXITED`` event with an expected exit code is received and the ``wait_exit`` rule is set for this process,
    * an error is encountered (``FATAL`` event, ``EXITED`` event with an unexpected exit code),
    * no ``STARTING`` event has been received 5 seconds after the XML-RPC.

This principle is used for starting a single process using a ``supvisors.start_process`` XML-RPC,


Extra Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using Supervisor, collegues have often asked if it would be possible to add extra arguments on the command line of a program without declaring them in the ini file. Indeed, the applicative context is evolving at runtime and it may be quite useful to give some information to the new process (options, path, URL of a server, URL of a display, ...), especially when dealing with distributed applications.

With Supervisor, it is possible to inform the process with  a ``supervisor.sendProcessStdin`` XML-RPC.
The first drawback is that it requires to update the source code of an existing program that is already capable of reading instructions from its command line. That is not always possible.
On the other hand, collegues found the solution so clumsy that they finally preferred to use a dedicated com to configure the process. Taste and colours...

So, **Supvisors** introduces a ``supvisors.start_args`` XML-RPC that is capable of taking into account extra arguments that are passed to the command line before the process is started.

.. attention:: *There is always a "but".*

    The extra arguments of the program are only known to:

        * the **Supvisors** instance that received the XML-RPC,
        * the Supervisor instance that received the ``supervisor.startProcess`` XML-RPC to start the process.

    If the ``autorestart`` option is ``true`` or ``unexpected``, the process with extra arguments cannot be warm restarted on a different address when the system crashes. Indeed, only the **Supvisors** Master instance is in charge of restarting the processes in this situation and the extra arguments are likely unknown to it.

    That's why there is *one* restriction to the use of this functionality:

        the ``autorestart`` option of the program shall be set to ``false``.

    Perhaps this restriction can be lifted in a next release.


Starting an application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application start sequence is defined at the beginning the the ``DEPLOYMENT`` phase of **Supvisors**.
It corresponds to a dictionary where:

    * the keys correspond to the list of ``start_sequence`` values defined in the program rules of the application,
    * the value associated to a key is the list of programs having this key as ``start_sequence``.

.. note::

	The programs having a ``start_sequence`` lower or equal to 0 are not considered, as they are not
	meant to be autostarted.

The internal *Starter* of **Supervisors** applies the following algorithm to start an application:

| while application start sequence is not empty:
|     pop the process list having the lower (strictly positive) ``start_sequence``
|
|     for each process in process list:
|         apply `Starting a process`_
|
|     wait for the jobs to complete
|

This principle is used for starting a single application using a ``supvisors.start_application`` XML-RPC.


Starting all applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When entering the ``DEPLOYMENT`` state, each **Supvisors** instance evaluates the global start sequence using
the ``start_sequence`` rule configured for the applications and processes.

The global start sequence corresponds to a dictionary where:

    * the keys correspond to the list of ``start_sequence`` values defined in the application rules,
    * the value associated to a key is the list of application start sequences whose applications have this key as ``start_sequence``.

The **Supvisors** Master instance uses the global start sequence to start the applications in the defined order.
The following pseudo-code explains the algorithm used:

| while global start sequence is not empty:
|     pop the application start sequences having the lower (strictly positive) ``start_sequence``
|
|     while application start sequences are not empty:
|
|         for each sequence in application start sequences:
|             pop the process list having the lower (strictly positive) ``start_sequence``
|
|             for each process in process list:
|                 apply `Starting a process`_
|
|         wait for the jobs to complete
|

.. note::

	The applications having a ``start_sequence`` lower or equal to 0 are not considered, as they are not
	meant to be autostarted.


.. _stopping_strategy:


Stopping strategy
-----------------

**Supvisors** provides a means to stop a process without telling explicitly where it is running.


Stopping a process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The internal *Stopper* of **Supervisors** applies the following algorithm to stop a process:

| if process state is ``RUNNING``:
|     perform a ``supervisor.stopProcess(namespec)`` XML-RPC to the Supervisor instance where the process is running
|

This single job is considered completed when:

    * a ``STOPPED`` event is received for this process,
    * an error is encountered (``FATAL`` event, ``EXITED`` event whatever the exit code),
    * no ``STOPPING`` event has been received 5 seconds after the XML-RPC.

This principle is used for stopping a single process using a ``supvisors.stop_process`` XML-RPC,


Stopping an application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application stop sequence is defined at the beginning the the ``DEPLOYMENT`` phase of **Supvisors**.
It corresponds to a dictionary where:

    * the keys correspond to the list of ``stop_sequence`` values defined in the program rules of the application,
    * the value associated to a key is the list of programs having this key as ``stop_sequence``.

The internal *Stopper* of **Supervisors** applies the following algorithm to stop an application:

| while application stop sequence is not empty:
|     pop the process list having the lower ``stop_sequence``
|
|     for each process in process list:
|         apply `Stopping a process`_
|
|     wait for the jobs to complete
|

This principle is used for stopping a single application using a ``supvisors.stop_application`` XML-RPC.


Stopping all applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The applications are stopped when **Supvisors** is requested to restart ot shut down.

When entering the ``DEPLOYMENT`` state, each **Supvisors** instance evaluates also the global stop sequence using
the ``stop_sequence`` rule configured for the applications and processes.

The global stop sequence corresponds to a dictionary where:

    * the keys correspond to the list of ``stop_sequence`` values defined in the application rules,
    * the value associated to a key is the list of application stop sequences whose applications have this key as ``stop_sequence``.

Upon reception of the ``supvisors.restart`` or ``supvisors.shutdown``, the **Supvisors** instance uses the global stop sequence
to stop all the running applications in the defined order.
The following pseudo-code explains the algorithm used:

| while global stop sequence is not empty:
|     pop the application stop sequences having the lower ``stop_sequence``
|
|     while application stop sequences are not empty:
|
|         for each sequence in application stop sequences:
|             pop the process list having the lower ``stop_sequence``
|
|             for each process in process list:
|                 apply `Stopping a process`_
|
|         wait for the jobs to complete
|


.. _conciliation:

Conciliation
------------

**Supvisors** is designed so that there should be only one instance of the same program running on a set of systems, although
all of them may have the capability to start it.

Nevetheless, it is still likely to happen in a few cases:

    * using a request to Supervisor itself (through web ui, supervisorctl, XML-RPC),
    * upon a network failure.

.. attention::

    In the case of a network failure, as described in :ref:`auto_fencing`, and if the ``auto_fence`` option is not set, the address
    is set to ``SILENT`` instead of ``ISOLATED`` and its URL is not disconnected from the ``SUBSCRIBER`` socket.
    
    When the network failure is fixed, **Supvisors** has likely to deal with a duplicated list of applications and processes.

When such a conflict is detected, **Supvisors** enters in a ``CONCILIATION`` phase. Depending on the ``conciliation_strategy`` option
set in the :ref:`supvisors_section`, it applies a strategy to be rid of all duplicates:

``SENICIDE``

    When applying the ``SENICIDE`` strategy, **Supvisors** keeps the youngest process, i.e. the process that has been started the
    most recently, and stops all the others.

``INFANTICIDE``

    When applying the ``INFANTICIDE`` strategy, **Supvisors** keeps the oldest process and stops all the others.

``USER``

    That's the easy one. When applying the ``USER`` strategy, **Supvisors** just waits for an user application to solve
    the conflicts using :command:`supervisorctl`, XML-RPC, process signals, or any other solution.

``STOP``

    When applying the ``STOP`` strategy, **Supvisors** stops all conflicting processes, which may lead the corresponding
    applications to a degraded state.

``RESTART``

    When applying the ``RESTART`` strategy, **Supvisors** stops all conflicting processes and restarts a new one.

``RUNNING_FAILURE``

    When applying the ``RUNNING_FAILURE`` strategy, **Supvisors** stops all conflicting processes and deals with the conflict
    as it would deal with a running failure, depending on the strategy defined for the process.
    So, after the conflicting processes are all stopped, **Supvisors** may restart the process, stop the application,
    restart the application or do nothing at all.

**Supvisors** leaves the ``CONCILIATION`` state when all conflicts are conciliated.
